# Quiz Game
## Overview
This website is the second project in the Code Institute course.

It showcases various programming skills and methods that I acquired during the course. 

Main languages used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## About Website
The quiz is designed to test general knowledge in various topics.

Quiz consists of 21 questions from the following categories:
* Arts
* Music
* History

* Each question is randomly selected from the categories above.
* Each question has a time limit of 15 seconds.
